Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: 
At high numbers of simulations some results are showing teams winning with 0% chance of winning.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 
The simulations starting to get good enough around 1000 simulations. That's a good sweetspot for good results and compute time.
